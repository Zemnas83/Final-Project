Title: PG County Libraries Visualization
Target Browser: Desktop, Google Chrome

This visualization provides the user a map that marks various libraries in PG County, MD. The project uses an API provided by PG County's open data source, found at the following URL: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/7k64-tdwr.json

The project uses the Leaflet JavaScript library, and the CSS framework is Boostrap v4.0. The project itself is displaying filtered queries of various libraries based on user input, and also showing the user the location of the filtered results. This makes it easy for the user to locate and find the specific libraries they are seeking.
